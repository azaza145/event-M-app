üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Area	Technology
üñ•Ô∏è Frontend	Angular, TypeScript, HTML/CSS (SCSS)
‚öôÔ∏è Backend	Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA
üóÑÔ∏è Database	PostgreSQL
üì¶ Build Tools	Maven (Backend), Angular CLI (Frontend)
üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The application follows a classic client-server architecture. The Angular frontend acts as the client, making HTTP requests to the Spring Boot backend, which serves as a RESTful API. The backend then communicates with the PostgreSQL database to persist and retrieve data.

Installation Guide

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.
Generated bash

      
git clone https://github.com/azaza145/event-M-app.git
cd event-M-app

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

2. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

The backend server must be running before you can use the frontend.
Generated bash

      
# Navigate into the backend directory
cd backend

# Create your local configuration file
# IMPORTANT: This file contains secrets and should NOT be committed to Git.
# Make sure your .gitignore file lists 'application.properties'.
cp src/main/resources/application-example.properties src/main/resources/application.properties

# Now, open src/main/resources/application.properties and fill in your
# actual database password, email app password, and a unique JWT secret.

# Build the project and run the server using Maven
mvn spring-boot:run

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

The backend API will now be running on http://localhost:8080.

3. Frontend Setup (Angular)

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project's root folder again.
Generated bash

      
# Navigate into the frontend directory from the root project folder
cd frontend

# Install all the required dependencies
npm install

# Start the Angular development server
ng serve

The frontend application will now be running. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:4200.
